### **Apache Kafka Learning Guide for Beginners**

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable real-time data streaming and processing. It is widely used for building real-time data pipelines, streaming analytics, and event-driven architectures. This guide will take you through the basics of Kafka, starting from installation and core concepts to practical examples.

---

### **1. What is Apache Kafka?**

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed messaging system used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It allows you to:
- **Publish** and **subscribe** to streams of records.
- **Store** streams of records in a fault-tolerant manner.
- **Process** streams of records either in real-time or in batch.

Kafka is used for logging, metrics collection, real-time data analysis, and much more in applications like microservices, big data pipelines, and real-time analytics.

### **Key Concepts to Understand**:

- **Producer**: A client that sends messages to a Kafka topic.
- **Consumer**: A client that reads messages from a Kafka topic.
- **Topic**: A category or feed name to which records are sent.
- **Partition**: Kafka topics are split into partitions to allow parallelism and scaling. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records.
- **Broker**: A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients. Multiple brokers can work together in a Kafka cluster.
- **ZooKeeper**: Manages and coordinates Kafka brokers. Kafka used to rely on ZooKeeper for distributed coordination, though newer versions (post-2.8) are moving toward removing the dependency on ZooKeeper.

---

### **2. Kafka Installation**

#### **a. Prerequisites**
- **Java** (Kafka runs on JVM, so you need Java installed). 
  - You can download Java from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
- **Apache Kafka**: Download Kafka from the [official Apache Kafka website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).

#### **b. Installation Steps**
1. **Download and Extract Kafka:**
   - Go to the [Apache Kafka download page](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads) and download the binary distribution.
   - Extract it to a directory on your local machine.
     ```bash
     tar -xvzf kafka_2.13-2.8.0.tgz
     cd kafka_2.13-2.8.0
     ```

2. **Start ZooKeeper**:
   - Kafka needs ZooKeeper for distributed coordination. Kafka ships with a simple ZooKeeper instance that you can use to get started.
   - Start ZooKeeper by running:
     ```bash
     bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
     ```

3. **Start Kafka Broker**:
   - Kafka brokers are the servers that store and manage data in Kafka. Start a Kafka broker by running:
     ```bash
     bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
     ```

Now Kafka is running locally, and you can start interacting with it.

---

### **3. Basic Kafka Operations**

#### **a. Creating a Topic**
A **topic** is a category where Kafka records (messages) are published. To create a new topic:

```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my_topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```

- **--topic**: Name of the topic.
- **--partitions**: The number of partitions for the topic (determines parallelism).
- **--replication-factor**: Number of replicas (typically 1 in development environments).

#### **b. Listing Topics**
To list all available topics in Kafka:

```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

#### **c. Sending Messages (Producer)**
A **producer** is a Kafka client that sends messages to topics. To send a message to the topic `my_topic`, run the following command:

```bash
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic my_topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

Once you run this command, you can type your messages in the terminal, and each line will be sent to the Kafka topic.

#### **d. Receiving Messages (Consumer)**
A **consumer** is a Kafka client that reads messages from topics. To consume messages from the topic `my_topic`, run the following command:

```bash
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic my_topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning
```

- **--from-beginning**: This flag ensures that you consume all messages from the beginning of the topic.

---

### **4. Kafka's Core Components**

#### **a. Producers**
A Kafka producer sends data to Kafka topics. Producers write to topics and can send data synchronously or asynchronously.

**Producer Example (Java)**:
```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import java.util.Properties;

public class SimpleProducer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
        props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
        producer.send(new ProducerRecord<String, String>("my_topic", "key", "Hello Kafka!"));
        producer.close();
    }
}
```

#### **b. Consumers**
A Kafka consumer subscribes to topics and processes incoming messages.

**Consumer Example (Java)**:
```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
import java.util.Properties;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SimpleConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
        props.put("group.id", "test");
        props.put("key.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        props.put("value.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");

        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
        consumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("my_topic"));

        while (true) {
            consumer.poll(100).forEach(record -> {
                System.out.printf("Consumed message: key=%s, value=%s\n", record.key(), record.value());
            });
        }
    }
}
```

#### **c. Kafka Streams**
Kafka Streams is a library for real-time stream processing on top of Kafka. It simplifies stream processing tasks like filtering, joining, and aggregating streams.

**Kafka Streams Example**:
```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "streams-example");
props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");

StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();
KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("input-topic");
KStream<String, String> transformed = source.mapValues(value -> "Transformed: " + value);
transformed.to("output-topic");

KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), props);
streams.start();
```

---

### **5. Kafka Use Cases**

Kafka is highly versatile and used across various industries. Some common use cases include:

- **Real-Time Analytics**: Collecting and processing large volumes of data in real time. For example, in monitoring and telemetry systems.
- **Log Aggregation**: Kafka is commonly used for collecting logs from different systems and making them available for analysis.
- **Event Sourcing**: Kafka allows building event-driven systems where the state is derived from a series of events (messages).
- **Data Integration**: Kafka can be used to move large volumes of data between different systems or applications.

---

### **6. Kafka Producers and Consumers in Practice**

#### **Producer-Consumer Example**
To better understand how producers and consumers work together, consider the following flow:
1. A **Producer** sends messages to Kafka topics.
2. A **Consumer** listens to those topics and processes the messages as they come in.

For a hands-on project, you can build a **simple real-time logging system**:
- The producer sends log messages (e.g., error, info, debug) to a Kafka topic.
- The consumer reads these messages and processes them for monitoring or alerting.

---

### **7. Kafka Configuration and Tuning**

Kafka offers several configurations to optimize performance, such as:
- **Batch size**: Control the size of messages in each batch.
- **Acks (Acknowledgments)**: Determine how many replicas need to acknowledge a message before it is considered written.
- **Replication Factor**: Control the number of Kafka broker copies of the data for fault tolerance.

Sample configuration (in `server.properties` file):
```properties
log.retention.hours=168
num.partitions=3
log.segment.bytes=1073741824
```

---

### **8. Kafka Advanced Features**

- **Kafka Connect**: A tool for integrating Kafka with external systems (databases, file systems, etc.).
- **Kafka Streams**: A client library for stream processing applications.
- **Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS)**: Kafka supports end-to-end exactly-once delivery semantics, which is crucial in processing and ensuring that records are not lost or duplicated.

---

### **9. Kafka Monitoring and Management**

Monitoring Kafka is critical to ensure its performance and health. Some key metrics to monitor include:
- **Consumer Lag**: The difference between the latest message offset and the consumer's last processed message.
- **Throughput**: The rate at which data is written and read from Kafka topics.
-

 **Broker Health**: Ensure that brokers are running, and their disk and network usage is within limits.

Tools for Kafka monitoring include **Kafka Manager**, **Confluent Control Center**, and **Prometheus** with **Grafana**.

---

### **10. Next Steps**

After mastering the basics, you can move on to:
- **Kafka Streams**: Learn stream processing in Kafka.
- **Kafka Connect**: Set up and configure Kafka connectors for different data sources.
- **Distributed Kafka**: Scale Kafka in a production environment across multiple nodes.

---

### **Conclusion**

Kafka is an essential tool in modern data architectures, especially for real-time data streaming. By following this guide, you should now have a solid understanding of Kafka’s key concepts, how to install and set up Kafka, and how to use it in real-world scenarios like producing and consuming messages.

### **Step 10: Next Steps for Learning Apache Kafka (Advanced Topics)**

After you've gained a solid foundation in Apache Kafka through the earlier steps, it’s time to move on to more advanced concepts and features that Kafka provides. These will help you build scalable, high-performance, and fault-tolerant event-driven architectures in production environments.

Let's explore the **next steps** for advanced Kafka topics:

---

### **1. Kafka Streams**

#### **What is Kafka Streams?**
Kafka Streams is a library that allows you to build real-time stream processing applications using Kafka. It enables you to process streams of data (records) stored in Kafka topics in real time and transform, aggregate, or filter them as required. 

Kafka Streams provides a lightweight library for processing streams of data, and it’s **fully integrated with Kafka**, making it simpler and more efficient for real-time applications.

#### **Key Features of Kafka Streams:**
- **Stateful and Stateless Processing**: Kafka Streams supports both types of operations. You can process data by transforming it, aggregating it, or joining it with other streams.
- **Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS)**: Kafka Streams supports exactly-once processing semantics, ensuring that data is neither lost nor duplicated during processing.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Kafka Streams handles failures gracefully by restoring its state from Kafka topics.
- **Scalability**: Kafka Streams applications can scale horizontally across multiple machines by partitioning the data and processing them in parallel.

#### **Kafka Streams Example:**

```java
import org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KStream;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KStreamBuilder;

import java.util.Properties;

public class SimpleStreamApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "streams-example");
        props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");

        KStreamBuilder builder = new KStreamBuilder();
        KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("input-topic");

        // Example transformation: Convert input to uppercase
        KStream<String, String> transformed = source.mapValues(value -> value.toUpperCase());
        transformed.to("output-topic");

        KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder, props);
        streams.start();
    }
}
```

This example reads from an **input-topic**, converts each record to uppercase, and writes the result to an **output-topic**.

---

### **2. Kafka Connect**

#### **What is Kafka Connect?**
Kafka Connect is a tool for **integrating Kafka with external systems** (e.g., databases, data warehouses, or file systems). It simplifies the process of transferring large amounts of data into and out of Kafka without needing to write custom integration code.

Kafka Connect comes with **source** connectors (for importing data into Kafka) and **sink** connectors (for exporting data from Kafka).

#### **Key Features of Kafka Connect:**
- **Simplifies integration**: With pre-built connectors, you can easily integrate Kafka with many data sources, including relational databases (JDBC), HDFS, Amazon S3, Elasticsearch, and more.
- **Scalability**: Kafka Connect can be run in standalone mode for simple use cases or in distributed mode for high-throughput, fault-tolerant use cases.
- **Fault tolerance**: Kafka Connect can manage failures, retrying failed messages, and ensuring data consistency.
  
#### **Common Kafka Connectors:**
- **JDBC Source/Sink Connector**: For integrating relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with Kafka.
- **FileStream Source/Sink Connector**: For reading from and writing to files.
- **HDFS Sink Connector**: For writing data from Kafka topics into Hadoop HDFS.
- **Elasticsearch Sink Connector**: For writing data from Kafka into Elasticsearch for search and analytics.

#### **Example: Using Kafka Connect with a JDBC Sink Connector**

If you want to move data from Kafka to a relational database, you can use the **JDBC Sink Connector**.

1. **Install the JDBC Connector**: 
   Download the JDBC Sink Connector from [Confluent Hub](https://www.confluent.io/hub/) and place it in the Kafka Connect plugin path.

2. **Configure the Connector** (e.g., in `connect-standalone.properties`):
   ```properties
   name=jdbc-sink
   connector.class=io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSinkConnector
   tasks.max=1
   topics=my_topic
   connection.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
   connection.user=root
   connection.password=password
   auto.create=true
   ```

3. **Run the Kafka Connect Worker**:
   ```bash
   bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/connect-jdbc-sink.properties
   ```

This setup would move messages from the Kafka topic **my_topic** into a MySQL table.

---

### **3. Distributed Kafka Architecture and Scalability**

#### **Why is Distributed Kafka important?**
Kafka is designed to be **distributed** from the start. In a production environment, Kafka clusters typically consist of multiple brokers to ensure **high availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **scalability**.

- **Replication**: Kafka automatically replicates data across brokers, ensuring that even if a broker fails, data is not lost.
- **Partitioning**: Kafka allows you to partition data across multiple brokers, ensuring parallelism in message processing. Each partition can be hosted on a different broker, allowing Kafka to scale horizontally.

#### **Scalability Example:**

To scale Kafka horizontally, you can:
- **Add more brokers** to your Kafka cluster.
- **Increase the number of partitions** for your topics to distribute the load across more brokers.
- **Set up consumer groups** to allow multiple consumers to read from partitions in parallel.

```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh --alter --topic my_topic --partitions 6 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

This command increases the number of partitions for the **my_topic** topic to 6, allowing greater parallelism and scalability.

---

### **4. Kafka Security**

Kafka has several features for securing data and managing access control.

#### **Security Features:**
- **Authentication**: Kafka supports authentication using **SASL** (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) with various mechanisms like GSSAPI (Kerberos), PLAIN, and SCRAM.
- **Authorization**: Kafka provides **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** to control which users and groups have access to specific topics, consumer groups, and other resources.
- **Encryption**: Kafka supports **SSL/TLS encryption** for data in transit to protect against eavesdropping and tampering.
- **Data Integrity**: Kafka uses **CRC checksums** to ensure data integrity.

#### **Setting Up SSL for Encryption**:
1. **Generate SSL Certificates**.
2. **Configure SSL on Kafka Broker** by adding the following to `server.properties`:
   ```properties
   listeners=SSL://localhost:9093
   listener.security.protocol=SSL
   ssl.keystore.location=/path/to/keystore
   ssl.keystore.password=your_password
   ssl.key.password=your_password
   ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/truststore
   ssl.truststore.password=your_password
   ```

---

### **5. Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS) in Kafka**

#### **What is Exactly-Once Semantics (EOS)?**
Kafka's **Exactly-Once Semantics** ensures that each record is neither lost nor processed more than once. This is especially useful for applications where data integrity is critical (e.g., financial transactions, logging).

- **Producers**: Kafka ensures that records sent by producers are **exactly once**. No record will be duplicated, even if the producer retries.
- **Consumers**: Kafka ensures that consumers can process records **exactly once**, even if a failure occurs during processing.

#### **Enabling EOS in Kafka Producer**:
For Kafka producers to support exactly-once semantics, set the following properties:
```properties
acks=all
transactional.id=my-transactional-id
```

#### **Enabling EOS in Kafka Consumer**:
On the consumer side, the Kafka consumer should commit offsets **exactly once**. This can be achieved by enabling **idempotent consumers**.

---

### **6. Monitoring and Management of Kafka Clusters**

#### **Why Monitoring is Important?**
In a large-scale production environment, it’s crucial to monitor the health and performance of Kafka clusters. Kafka provides many metrics out of the box, including:
- **Broker metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, etc.
- **Consumer metrics**: Lag between consumer and producer.
- **Producer metrics**: Latency, throughput, etc.

#### **Popular Monitoring Tools**:
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Used to collect and visualize Kafka metrics.
- **Confluent Control Center**: A GUI-based tool provided by Confluent for managing and monitoring Kafka clusters.
- **Kafka Manager**: A web-based tool for managing and monitoring Kafka clusters.

#### **Setting Up Prometheus and Grafana for Kafka Monitoring**:
1. **Kafka Exporter**: Use the Kafka Exporter to expose metrics to Prometheus.
   - Dockerize the Kafka Exporter.
   - Configure Prometheus to scrape Kafka metrics.
2. **Grafana Dashboards**: Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize Kafka metrics, such as consumer lag, broker health, and throughput.

---

### **7. Kafka in Cloud and Kubernetes**

Deploying Kafka in the cloud or on Kubernetes involves several challenges, including:
- **Scaling**: Ensuring your Kafka brokers and consumers scale dynamically.
- **Networking**: Ens

uring proper communication between Kafka brokers, Zookeeper nodes, and clients.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Setting up replication and backups in case of failure.

#### **Deploying Kafka on Kubernetes**:
- **Helm Charts**: You can use Helm charts to deploy Kafka on Kubernetes.
- **Strimzi**: A Kubernetes operator for Kafka, which simplifies the deployment and management of Kafka clusters on Kubernetes.

---

### **Conclusion**

These advanced topics will help you build robust, scalable, and production-grade Kafka systems. Once you have mastered the core concepts, diving deeper into stream processing with **Kafka Streams**, managing Kafka at scale, integrating it with external systems using **Kafka Connect**, and implementing **Kafka security** will set you up for success in real-world big data and streaming applications.

Happy learning and building with Apache Kafka! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

### **Beginner Apache Kafka Project Ideas**

Once you have a basic understanding of Apache Kafka, it's time to apply your knowledge to real-world projects. These beginner-level projects will help you get hands-on experience in working with Kafka, whether it's for data streaming, real-time analytics, or building event-driven applications.

Here are a few simple project ideas that are perfect for beginners learning Kafka:

---

### **1. Real-Time Twitter Feed Analyzer**

**Objective:** Use Apache Kafka to collect, stream, and analyze Twitter feeds in real-time.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Set up Kafka:**
   - Start a Kafka cluster locally or on a cloud service (e.g., Confluent Cloud).
   - Create a Kafka topic called `twitter-stream`.

2. **Twitter API Integration:**
   - Use the Twitter API to fetch tweets based on certain keywords or hashtags.
   - Use a Python or Java producer to push the tweets to the Kafka `twitter-stream` topic.

   **Python Example:**
   - Install `tweepy` (for Twitter API) and `kafka-python` (for Kafka).
   ```bash
   pip install tweepy kafka-python
   ```

   ```python
   import tweepy
   from kafka import KafkaProducer

   # Twitter API setup
   consumer_key = "your_consumer_key"
   consumer_secret = "your_consumer_secret"
   access_token = "your_access_token"
   access_secret = "your_access_secret"

   auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
   auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_secret)
   api = tweepy.API(auth)

   # Kafka Producer setup
   producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

   # Define a function to stream tweets
   class MyStreamListener(tweepy.StreamListener):
       def on_status(self, status):
           tweet = status.text
           producer.send('twitter-stream', value=tweet.encode())

   # Stream tweets containing the word "Kafka"
   my_stream_listener = MyStreamListener()
   my_stream = tweepy.Stream(auth=api.auth, listener=my_stream_listener)
   my_stream.filter(track=['Kafka'])
   ```

3. **Stream Processing:**
   - Use a Kafka consumer to consume the tweets in real-time and analyze them.
   - Perform sentiment analysis or count occurrences of certain words, hashtags, or mentions.

   **Sentiment Analysis Example (Python with TextBlob):**
   ```python
   from kafka import KafkaConsumer
   from textblob import TextBlob

   # Kafka Consumer setup
   consumer = KafkaConsumer('twitter-stream', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

   for message in consumer:
       tweet = message.value.decode()
       blob = TextBlob(tweet)
       sentiment = "Positive" if blob.sentiment.polarity > 0 else "Negative"
       print(f"Tweet: {tweet}\nSentiment: {sentiment}")
   ```

4. **Store Results:**  
   - You can store the processed data (e.g., sentiment score) to a database or visualize it using tools like **Grafana** or **Power BI**.

#### **Outcome:**  
- You will have a system that pulls real-time data from Twitter, processes it for sentiment analysis, and provides insights in real-time.

---

### **2. Real-Time Weather Data Streaming**

**Objective:** Stream weather data from an API and send it to Kafka for real-time monitoring.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Set up Kafka:**
   - Create a Kafka topic called `weather-data`.

2. **Weather API Integration:**
   - Use an open weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch weather data for different cities.
   - Use a Kafka producer to send the weather data to Kafka.

   **Python Example for Fetching Weather Data:**
   ```python
   import requests
   from kafka import KafkaProducer
   import json
   import time

   # OpenWeatherMap API setup
   api_key = 'your_api_key'
   city = 'New York'
   url = f'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}'

   # Kafka Producer setup
   producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))

   while True:
       response = requests.get(url)
       weather_data = response.json()
       producer.send('weather-data', value=weather_data)
       time.sleep(60)  # Fetch new data every minute
   ```

3. **Stream Processing:**
   - Use a Kafka consumer to consume the weather data and analyze trends (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).
   - You can filter the data, calculate averages, or track weather patterns.

   **Example Consumer:**
   ```python
   from kafka import KafkaConsumer
   import json

   consumer = KafkaConsumer('weather-data', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8')))

   for message in consumer:
       weather = message.value
       print(f"Weather in {weather['name']}: {weather['weather'][0]['description']}")
       print(f"Temperature: {weather['main']['temp']}°K")
   ```

4. **Visualize the Data:**
   - Use tools like **Grafana** or **Kibana** to visualize the weather data in real-time, showing metrics like temperature, humidity, and weather condition trends.

#### **Outcome:**
- This project helps you learn how to integrate external APIs with Kafka, stream real-time data, and process it in real-time.

---

### **3. Simple Log Aggregation System**

**Objective:** Collect log data from various services and aggregate it using Kafka to make it available for real-time analysis.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Set up Kafka:**
   - Create a Kafka topic called `logs`.

2. **Log Data Generation:**
   - Simulate log generation using different services (e.g., web servers, applications) by producing log messages to Kafka.

   **Example Python Producer (Simulating logs):**
   ```python
   import random
   import time
   from kafka import KafkaProducer

   # Kafka Producer setup
   producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

   log_levels = ['INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR']

   while True:
       log_message = f"{random.choice(log_levels)}: A sample log message."
       producer.send('logs', value=log_message.encode())
       time.sleep(2)  # Simulate log generation every 2 seconds
   ```

3. **Consume and Aggregate Logs:**
   - Use a Kafka consumer to read the logs and filter by log level (e.g., errors).
   - Aggregate logs over time or by specific criteria (e.g., count the number of errors in the last 10 minutes).

   **Example Consumer (Aggregating Logs):**
   ```python
   from kafka import KafkaConsumer

   consumer = KafkaConsumer('logs', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

   error_count = 0
   for message in consumer:
       log = message.value.decode()
       if 'ERROR' in log:
           error_count += 1
       print(f"Total Errors: {error_count}")
   ```

4. **Storage or Alerts:**
   - Once logs are aggregated, store them in a database or use a monitoring tool like **Prometheus** to alert if a high number of errors are detected in real-time.

#### **Outcome:**
- You will create a basic **log aggregation** system using Kafka that can aggregate logs from different services in real-time, helping you analyze log data efficiently.

---

### **4. Real-Time User Activity Tracking**

**Objective:** Track user activity on a website or app in real-time and stream the data to Kafka for analysis.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Set up Kafka:**
   - Create a Kafka topic called `user-activity`.

2. **Simulate User Activity Data:**
   - Use a Kafka producer to simulate user interactions (e.g., page views, clicks).

   **Example Producer (Simulating User Activity):**
   ```python
   import random
   import time
   from kafka import KafkaProducer
   import json

   # Kafka Producer setup
   producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))

   user_actions = ['page_view', 'click', 'login', 'logout']

   while True:
       user_activity = {
           'user_id': random.randint(1, 1000),
           'action': random.choice(user_actions),
           'timestamp': time.time()
       }
       producer.send('user-activity', value=user_activity)
       time.sleep(1)  # Simulate user activity every second
   ```

3. **Analyze the User Activity Data:**
   - Use a Kafka consumer to consume the data and analyze it. For example, track the number of logins or page views per user.

   **Example Consumer (Tracking Logins):**
   ```python
   from kafka import KafkaConsumer
   import json

   consumer = KafkaConsumer('user-activity', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8')))

   login_count = 0
   for message in consumer:
       activity = message.value
       if activity['action'] == 'login':
